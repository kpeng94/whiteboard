INSTRUCTIONS ON STARTING THE SERVER AND CLIENT
To start the server, you must run the WhiteboardMainServer.java class. 
If running from terminal, the --port [PORT] flag will use the port specified. The default port is 4444 if no flag is specified.
The server will attempt to listen to both localhost (127.0.0.1) as well as any Internet-connected IP addresses, given there is no external firewall blocking the connection.

To start the client, you must run the WhiteboardClientMain.java class. 
After running the WhiteboardClientMain.java class, a popup will appear, and you can connect to the server by entering the IP address of the server, the port number, and a username.
The default port is port 4444, although this may need to be changed if the server is started with the --port [PORT] flag.
